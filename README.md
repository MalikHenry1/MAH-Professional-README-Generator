  ## Description 
  
  This project generates a high-quality README.md file created from user inputs.
    
  ## Installation 
  
  There are two required packages that must be installed in order for this application to function properly: the inquirer package which provides the user with prompts and the fs module which provides the framework that syncs the user inputs into the generated markdown file.

  ## Usage 
  
  This application can be used as a template to generate a high-quality README.md file for any created project or application. Using the command 
  node index.js, the user is presented with a series of prompts (name, project description, etc.) which are inserted into the markdown file using 
  JavaScript.
